## NFL Statistics Webpage.


## Name

Jaymon Pysnack

## Install Instructions
In terminal, run npm install, then run "node server.js".

## Data:
Statistics are from https://www.pro-football-reference.com. As I have no API to access,
I have to manually update this.

## 3 Tasks the user can do
- The user can search players by name, and any that have the typed string of characters in their name show up
- The user can sort players by specific stats, and the leaders, as well as the stat itself, show up.
- Users can compare as many players as they want by pressing the "compare" button, and then selecting the "compare" tab at the top
